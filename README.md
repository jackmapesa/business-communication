Thinking about what to say, working out the best way of saying it, finding the right words, making sure the <br>other person understands and understanding anything he\she says in reply are all vital stages in communication.<br>
<h3><b><u>What is Communication?</b></u><br></h3>
The word “communication" was derived from the Latin word “Communicare” that means to impart, to participate, to share or to make common.<br>
It is a process of exchanging facts, ideas, attitude, feelings, actions, experiences and opinions as a means<br> that individual or organization share meaning and understand with one another. <br>
Communication is a process in which people share information, ideas and feelings.<br>
How communication process  happen?<br>
Communication is a process which follow a procedure where a message or information is  transmitted  from a sender to a receiver by using a medium of communication.<br>
The message goes through five stages when it is sent by the sender to the receiver. These stages are as follows:-<br>
<h3><b><u>Communication Process</b></u><br></h3>
The communication process comprises of the following components: Sender -the sender is the entity that conveys or sends the message. <br>
Should show credibility by displaying knowledge of the subject, the audience and the context <br>
At this stage, an idea, thought or feeling is formulated in the mind of the sender as a result of an external of internal stimulus or motivation. <br>
Message - is what is being transmitted from sender to receiver.<br>
Consider the message structure, tone, validity of the argument and the content.<br>
Encoding - encoding is a process through which the message is symbolized. It involves giving the message a communication form.<br>
Channel - channel is the medium through which message is being sent. The sender selects the most appropriate <br>and effective vehicle that will deliver the message to the receiver.<br>
This includes: Verbal (face-to-face, meetings, telephone, videoconferencing); Written (letters, emails, memos, reports) <br>and nonverbal (gestures, facial expressions, and body movements) Consider the choice of the channel.<br>
Receiver-Consumer/destination of the message<br>
Feedback- Returned message or response<br>
It is the reaction to your communicated message. <br>
It helps you assess whether the message is understood <br>
<h4><b><u>Context </b></u><br></h4>
Refers to the surrounding environment or culture (i.e corporate or international) <br>
<h4><b><u> Noise</b></u><br></h4>

What makes communication to breakdown ?/What are the barriers of communication?<br>
<ol>
Barriers are anything that cause communication to breakdown between the sender and receiver</li>
<li>If the language used is not known to both the sender and the receiver.</li>
<li>If the media used is not accessible or understandable to the audience e.g. Using news paper to illiterate society or TV to people who can’t afford that one.</li>
<li>If the message is distorted either exaggerated or misinterpreted.</li>
<li>If the knowledge transmitted is too much advanced for the receiver to understand eg. in classroom situation</li>
<li>Faults in the mass media e.g. due to  power cuts, technical faults ,inaccuracy in reception e.g. due to antenna problems.</li>
<li>If the message is blocked by a middle person and does not reach the targeted person e.g. a secretary may receive information for his boss ,but deliberately or by forgetting she may fail to tell her boss.</li>
<li>If the information delays to reach the targeted person or reaches the person after the expected time it should have reached the receiver.</li>
<li>If the speaker is using the low voice, speaks in complicated language may cause the message to not be delivered effectively.</li>
</ol>
Generally, barriers of communication are caused by all elements of communication such as:<br>
Source, Message. Channel, Receiver, Feedback, Context, etc.<br>
Question<br>
What makes the communication process effective/ ineffective in the context of cyber security?<br>
Types/ Forms of Communication<br>
There are two types of communication based on channel; <br>
<ul>
 <li>Verbal communication </li>
<li>Written Communication</li>
<li>Nonverbal communication.</li>
</ul>

<h4><i>Verbal/ Oral Communication<br></i></h4>
Verbal communication refers to the form of communication in which message is transmitted verbally; communication is done by word of mouth and writing. <br>
Objective of every communication is to have people understand what we are trying to convey. <br>
In verbal communication, always remember the acronym KISS - keep it short and simple. <br>
When we talk to others, we assume that others understand what we are saying because we know what we are saying. But this is not the case.<br> 

<h4>Oral/ Spoken Communication<br></h4>
Usually people bring their own attitude, perception, emotions and thoughts about the topic and hence creates barrier in delivering the right meaning.<br> 
In oral communication, spoken words are used. <br>
It includes face-to-face conversations, speech, telephonic conversation, video, radio, television, voice over internet. <br>
Examples of spoken communication that is used in the workplace include conversations, interviews, <br>counseling/helping colleagues, meetings, conferences and so on (Wenbin Nah, 2008). 
<br>In oral communication, communication is influenced by pitch, volume, speed and clarity of speaking. <br>

<u><b>The following are the advantages of communication:-</b><br></u>
<ol>
<li>Oral communication allows for immediate feedback such as the opportunity to ask questions when the meaning is not entirely clear. </li>
<li>The sender is able to check and see whether if the instruction is clear or has created confusion.</li>

<li> It requires attentiveness and great receptivity on part of the receivers/audience.</li>
<li>Oral communication (such as speeches) is not frequently used as legal records except in investigation work.</li>
<li>Spoken communication is influenced by both verbal and non-verbal communication such as <br>tone or body language which may twist the meaning of your message in the mind of the receiver.</li>
</ol>
<u><b>Written Communication<br></u></b>

A written message may be printed or hand written.<br>
In written communication message can be transmitted via, letter, report, memo, reports, bulletins, job descriptions,<br> employee manuals, and electronic mail are the types of written communication used for internal communication.
For communicating with external environment in writing, electronic mail, Internet Web sites, letters, proposals, <br>telegrams,faxes, postcards,contracts, advertisements, brochures, and news releases are used (Wenbin Nah, 2008).
